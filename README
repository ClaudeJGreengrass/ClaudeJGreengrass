The Essential Tremor Lab is a workshop for the Citizen Scientist interested in the measurement, diagnosis, and possible treatment of Essential Tremors.


At present we have a working proof-of-concept tremor device that will:


* Measure the postural tremor in your hand/forearm
* Apply electrical stimulation to the Radial and Medial nerves in the forearm alternating the stimulation at the frequency of your tremor
* With stimulus provided by a battery powered commercial TENS unit for the supply of the electrical stimulus
* Will be simple to replicate without the need for any special skills or tools


All the hardware is COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) that is reasonably priced. We have experienced some delays in ordering components due to world wide silicon chip shortages. A complete list of all required components is available.
